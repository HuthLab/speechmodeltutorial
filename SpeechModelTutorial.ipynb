    "# Modeling the Representation of Speech in the Brain\n",
    "Originally given as a tutorial at EACL 2014 by Alex Huth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial you will step through a voxel-wise modeling analysis. You will use computational models to extract semantic features from a natural speech stimulus. Then these features will be used to build linear models of fMRI data, and model weights and prediction performance will be visualized.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you so desire, you can step through this entire tutorial without modifying any code. But there are a few points where you will be able to make simply modifications and then see what effect those modifications have on the results. Additionally at the end you can re-run the model using phoneme features instead of semantic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Acknowledgements\n",

    "## The experiment\n",
    "In this experiment a subject underwent fMRI scanning while they listened to roughly 2 hours of natural narrative speech stimuli.

    "## The semantic model: English1000\n",
    "Here you will load a precomputed vector-space semantic model. This semantic model will transform any word (well, any word it knows about) into a 985-dimensional vector. This 985-dimensional semantic space has the nice property that words that are close together tend to have similar meanings. Although it would have been fun to have tried reconstructing this semantic model in this tutorial, it takes a really long time and it doesn't seem like the parameters matter that much. So today you're just going to work with the preconstructed semantic model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic model was constructed using a decently large corpus of text (a couple billion words, comprising the stories used as stimuli here, 604 popular books, 2,405,569 wikipedia pages, and 36,333,459 user comments scraped from reddit.com) and a lexicon of roughly 10,000 words. We selected 985 \"basis words\" from the Wikipedia \"List of 1000 basic words\" (contrary to the title, this lost does not actually contain 1000 words, but this is where the title of the model comes from). These are common words that span many topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We constructed a word co-occurrence matrix, $M$, with 985 rows and 10,470 columns. Iterating through the training corpus, we added 1 to $M_{ij}$ each time word $j$ appeared within 15 words of basis word $i$. The window size of 15 was selected to be large enough to suppress syntactic effects (word order) but no larger. Once the co-occurrence matrix was complete, we log transformed the counts, replacing $M_{ij}$ with $\\log(1 + M_{ij})$. Then each row of M was z-scored to correct for differences in basis word frequency, and finally each column of $M$ was z-scored to correct for word frequency. The resulting matrix is the one you're loading here.\n",
    "\n",
    "(As an aside, while I constructed this model in a totally ad hoc and unplanned way, it has properties that are very similar to Mikolov's [word2vec model](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) that's recently gained a lot of popularity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, here you are going to load the model and then play with it a bit to see how it works."

The resulting changes in blood oxygenation (which increases) and volume (which also increases) create the magnetic signature that is recorded by fMRI. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this process is **slow**. It takes seconds after the neural activity begins for the blood vessels to dilate and for the BOLD response to become apparent. And then it takes more seconds for the response to go away. So although a neural response might only last milliseconds, the associated BOLD response will rise and fall over a span of maybe 10 seconds, orders of magnitude slower. The shape of this rise and fall is called the [hemodynamic response function (HRF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haemodynamic_response).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a pretty standard looking example of an HRF:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='http://www.brainmatters.nl/wp-content/uploads/bold.png' width=350px></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FIR model\n",
    "To accurately model how the brain responds to these stimuli we must also model the HRF. There are many ways to do this. The most common is to assume that the HRF follows a canonical shape. But this approach turns out to not work very well: different parts of the brain have very different vasculature (blood vessels), so the HRF shape can vary a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, what you are going to here is estimate a separate HRF for each semantic feature in each voxel that is being modeled. This estimate is going to take the form of a linear finite impulse response (FIR) model. The linear FIR form is particularly nice to use because it's very simple to estimate and powerful (if anything, it might be too powerful.. more on that later). To build a linear FIR model all you have to do is concatenate together multiple delayed copies of the stimulus. I usually use four delays: 1, 2, 3, and 4 time points. The resulting delayed features can be thought of as representing the stimulus 1, 2, 3, and 4 time points ago. So the regression weights for those features will represent how a particular voxel responds to a feature 1, 2, 3, or 4 time points in the past, and these regression weights are a 4-point estimate of the HRF for that feature in that voxel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential downside of the FIR model is that it may be too expressive. Each feature in each voxel is allowed to have any HRF, but this comes at the cost of multiplying the total number of regression weights that we must fit by the number of delays. In all likelihood the true HRFs vary, but they don't vary that much, so we probably don't need this many independent features. This cost becomes apparent if you increase the number of delays. This will slow down model fitting and likely decrease the stability of the regression weights, leading to decreased model performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with the number of delays and see how it affects the model results!"

    "Finally, the core of the analysis: you will fit a regression model that predicts the responses of each voxel as a weighted sum of the semantic features. This model will then be tested using a held out dataset (the Prediction dataset). And if the model proves to be reasonably predictive, then the weights of the regression model will tell us what semantic features each voxel responds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a linear regression model, so if the response time course for voxel $j$ is $R_j$, the stimulus time course for semantic feature $i$ is $S_i$, and the regression weight for feature $i$ in voxel $j$ is $\\beta_{ij}$, then the model can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{R}_j = \\beta_{0j} S_0 + \\beta_{1j} S_1 + \\cdots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{R}_j = \\sum_i \\beta_{ij} S_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The trick, of course, is accurately estimating the $\\beta_j$ values. This is commonly done by minimizing the sum of the squared error (here across time, $t$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_j(\\beta) = \\sum_t (R_{jt} - \\hat{R}_{jt})^2 = \\sum_t (R_{jt} - \\sum_i \\beta_{i} S_{it})^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\beta_j = \\underset{\\beta}{\\operatorname{argmin}} E_j(\\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing $\\beta$ this way is called ordinary least squares (OLS), and this will not work in our case because the total number of features (3940) is smaller than the number of time points (3737). (It would be possible if the number of delays was smaller than 4, but it would give terrible results.. feel free to try it! OLS can be performed using the function `np.linalg.lstsq`.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In almost every case, linear regression can be improved by making some prior assumptions about the weights (or, equivalently, about the covariance structure of the stimuli). This is called **regularization**, or **regularized linear regression**. One way to do this is to penalize the error function by the sum of the squared weights. This is commonly known as **ridge regression**, and is a special case of [Tikhonov regularization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ridge_regression). It finds the $\\beta$ that minimizes the following error function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E_j(\\beta) = \\sum_t (R_{jt} - \\sum_i \\beta_{i} S_{it})^2 + \\alpha \\sum_i \\beta_i^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(In practice we will use a different formulation that involves re-weighting the singular values of the matrix $S$ before computing its pseudoinverse. This method achieves the same results but is extremely efficient because it uses all the linear algebra machinery that computers are so good at to build many models in parallel.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The hyperparameter: $\\alpha$\n",
    "You may have noticed in the equation above that we have introduced a new parameter, $\\alpha$, which controls the strength of the regularization. If $\\alpha$ is set to zero, then we get back to exactly the OLS formulation (above). As $\\alpha$ goes to infinity, the regularization forces all the weights to go to zero (in practice this also has the slightly weirder effect of making all the weights independent, as if each feature was regressed separately on the responses).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we choose $\\alpha$? We're going to do it here using cross-validation. First, we split the Regression dataset up into two parts. Then we estimate the weights for a given $\\alpha$ on the first part, and test how well we can predict responses on the second part. This is repeated for each possible $\\alpha$ that we want to test, and for a couple different splits of the Regression dataset. Then we find the $\\alpha^*$ that gave us the best predictions within the split Regression dataset. Finally we estimate the weights using the entire Regression dataset and the selected $\\alpha^*$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this is an annoying and laborious process, I've encapsulated it within the function `bootstrap_ridge`. You simply give this function your datasets, the possible $\\alpha$ values, and a few parameters for the cross-validation, and it does all the rest. The parameter `nboots` determines the number of cross-validation tests that will be run. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do cross-validation, `bootstrap_ridge` divides the Regression dataset into many small chunks, and then splits those chunks into the two groups that will be used to estimate weights and test $\\alpha$ values. This is better than just choosing individual time points because both the fMRI data and stimuli are autocorrelated (i.e. correlated across time). The parameter `chunklen` determines the length of the chunks, and the parameter `nchunks` determines the number of chunks in the $\\alpha$-testing dataset. By default I set `chunklen` to 40 time points (80-second chunks), and set `nchunks` to 20 (40 * 20 = 800 time points for testing $\\alpha$ values, 3737-800 = 2937 time points for estimating weights). These values should not matter too much.\n",

    "In the mosaic we can see that there seem to be some concentrated areas of high correlation. But it's hard to say where in the brain those areas are based on the mosaic. So next you're going to create a fancy 3D visualization of the correlations using pyCortex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've opened the viewer you'll be presented with a 3D view of the brain with colors showing the correlations. White outlines and labels show the locations of known brain areas (motor, somatosensory, visual, and some language areas). Drag around with your left mouse button to rotate the view, and the right mouse button to zoom in or out. \n",
    "\n",
    "By default you'll see a view of the cortex as it looks in reality: folded and convoluted. To better see parts of the brain that are hidden down in the folds, you can press \"i\" to see an inflated view (or drag the \"Mix\" slider at the bottom of the screen to the middle). This helps to see the data, but you will still need to rotate the brain to see all of it. To make the entire cortex visible at once, you can press \"f\" to see a flattened view. To create this view we cut the cortical surface at a few locations, and then flattened it out so that it can all be seen at once (but this introduces some distortions)."
